The Seven Magic Mountains is a public art installation located in the Ivanpah Valley desert, approximately ten miles south of Las Vegas, Nevada1. The installation consists of seven towers of colorful, stacked boulders standing more than 25 ft. high1. The artist behind this installation is Ugo Rondinone2.

The significance of the Seven Magic Mountains is to allow visitors to consider the vastness of the desert while pondering the stories of humans that have lived and traveled through its natural abundant space over time3. The 7 Magic Mountains are meant to symbolize the contrast between natural and artificial environments3.

I hope that helps!

About me


I come from the automation control system industry, where I discovered the amazing contrast between natural and artificial sparks that have shaped our history and culture. I think that WEB DESIGN is one of the best ways to express the beauty of this contrast, as it blends art and technology in a harmonious way. This inspired me to enroll in She Codes, a program that empowers women to learn how to code and bring in a vibe to tech industry with more women's contribution
